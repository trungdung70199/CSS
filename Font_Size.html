<!-- Font size: property sets the size of the text -->
<!-- Absolute size:
Sets the text to a specified size
Does not allow a user to change the text size in all
browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
Absolute size is useful when the physical size of
the output is known  -->
<!-- Relative size:
Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
Allows a user to change the text size in browsers -->
<!-- Set Font Size With Em -->
<!-- 1em = 16px -->
<!-- Viewport is the browser window size.
1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is
50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm -->

            Specifying the font-size in em allows all
            major browser to resize the text. Unfortunately,
            there is still a problem with older versions
            of IE. When resizing the text, it become larger/
            smaller than it should.
